# Gemini Collaboration File

This file is used to store information and context for collaboration with Gemini.

## Project Goals

This project aims to develop a cross-platform application using Flutter, targeting:
- Android
- iOS
- Windows
- Linux
- Web

The architecture will consist of:
- A frontend running in a Docker container.
- A backend running in a separate Docker container.

Database considerations:
- A SQL database for the backend.
- A SQL database for the frontend (likely for local data persistence, e.g., SQLite).

## Important Notes

[TODO: Add any important notes or context for Gemini here.]

## Memories

[Gemini can store memories here using the `save_memory` tool.]
